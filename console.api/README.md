# S3.VM.CONSOLE

This project uses WebMKS to display a VM console.

## Build notes:

The `appsettings.json` file will be checked into source control. Do not change this file unless adding or removing settings. Use this as an example file only.

Use `{env.EnvironmentName}.json` as your configuration file as it will not be checked into source control.
`{env.EnvironmentName} values`: `development`, `staging`, `production`

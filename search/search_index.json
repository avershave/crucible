That is, Destroy creates a plan that will destroy all of the previously deployed resources in a workspace.</p> <p>Note: If a resource is defined in the configuration and created in a run and then deleted from the configuration, it is destroyed upon the next plan or destroy run.

A common example of an app used in Player is the Mattermost messaging platform.</p> <p>App Template: The settings associated with an app that is added to a team's View.  An app template can be created for common apps that are added to a view with default settings that an administrator can override if needed.</p> <p>Authentication: Player uses IdentityServer 4 to authenticate users. Authentication gets a user into Player. However, to determine what a user can open and/or edit within Player, administrators need to set the required permissions within the Player Administration View under the Users Administrator tab.</p> <p>Focused Application Panel: The focused app panel displays the selected application in an iFrame. The iFrame points to the URL specified by the application template. The application within the focused app panel is responsible for authentication and content. Player displays content but has no control of the application running within the focused app panel.</p> <p>Notification: A message sent to a specific user, team, or view from an Administrator or an app that has been given permission.</p> <p>Permission: A key/value pair that can be created and used by any application given permission within the system. A permission can be assigned to a user or a team. Some permissions such as <code>SystemAdmin</code> are read-only. <code>ExerciseAdmin</code> and <code>SystemAdmin</code> are permanent permissions that cannot be edited or deleted.</p> <p>Role: A set of permissions that can be grouped together and assigned to a user or team.</p> <p>Team: A group of logged in users who are associated with a view. Each team can be configured to view a particular set of applications and be granted team-level roles/permissions.</p> <p>User: A user who is identified in an Identity Server configured for the Player system is automatically added into Player upon the first login. In addition, users can be pre-loaded into Player using the Player API.</p> <p>Note: IdentityServer4 is an OAuth 2.0 framework that is used by the Software Engineering Institute to authenticate users. Some Identity servers are configured to authenticate using CAC cards while others are user/password based - depending upon the location of the system.</p> <p>View: These are the settings associated with building a view. A view can be edited, cloned, and deleted.</p> <p>Views: The collection of content a participant can interact with during a cyber simulation.

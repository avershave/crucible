# Blueprint Overview

Simplifies the creation and visualization of a Master Scenario Event List (MSEL) and injects easier to perform. Allowing users with correct permissions to interact in real-time with the MSEL. Eliminating the traditional method of sharing multiple copies of spreadsheets to select/define the simulated entities, attacks, timeframe, regulators impacted by the scenario, etc.

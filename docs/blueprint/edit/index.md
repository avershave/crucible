# Blueprint MSEL Editing

MSEL Editing Functionalities Overview

After uploading or creating a MSEL, users will be given the ability to edit any desired information, as well as add additional information to the MSEL. 

With this functionality, users can now edit the same MSEL, instead of each user having their own copy and then sending their edits to the user responsible of recompiling all the edits together. By allowing users to access the MSEL on-the-fly, this will ensure that everyone will have the same copy of the MSEL on the day of the live scenario, so that no one is confused on the day of the exercise.

## Info Tab

On this tab, users will be able to edit basic information, such as MSEL Description and MSEL Status.

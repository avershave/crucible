# Blueprint MSEL Exercise Overview

The Exercise View tab will recompile all the information added during the edits and display it to the user in an organized view.

With this organized view, users will be able to see all the information from the MSEL and understand the important key factors of the MSEL, as well as provide an on-the-fly view which users will be able to access and see any edits done to the MSEL and locate anything missing or wrong.

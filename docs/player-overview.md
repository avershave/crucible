# Player Overview

**Player** is the centralized interface where participants, teams, and administrators go to engage in a cyber event. In Player, participants view teams, applications, virtual environments, and third-party applications. The event experience is highly customizable by content developers.

Think of Player as the front door to an event running on Crucible. Player is meant to: 

- Provide a platform for individual participants on a team to view content in an exercise.
- Allow for quick navigation between various applications in the Crucible framework.
- Allows administrators to set which teams can see which applications.

Applications can use Player roles and permissions as needed. Notifications can be sent to individual users, teams, or the entire exercise by an administrator or an application with proper permissions.

Player is ***not*** meant to:

- Control any authentication or content within any application that it displays in a content panel.
- Provide any mechanisms for individual applications to communicate with each other.
- Provide any default applications.  However, some common applications can be consumed within an exercise.

Descriptions of the common applications used in Player can be found in the [Player Applications](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/player-applications) document.

# User Permissions

- CITE contains three levels of permissions that affect the way a team score is collaborated on and edited.
    - **Basic**: Can only view the team score.
    - **Modify**: Can view and edit the team score.
    - **Submit**: Can view, edit, and submit the team score.
- These roles will be defined per team by the team.
- Most users will have the modify-level permission.
- Only one or two users per team will have submit-level permission. (This means that only one or two users can edit and/or submit on the team score.)

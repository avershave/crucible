# User-Entered Roles

- Assuming that the user has been granted the appropriate permissions by the exercise administrator, the user will now be able to add a new role.
- The use of roles will allow the team to customize their response by tracking tasks and roles during the exercise.
- Roles will be added per incident.

To add a new role:
- In the top-right corner, click the **"Administration"** gear icon.
- Select **"Roles"**, then click **"Add Role"**.
- Enter a new **"Role Name"**. (Users can only add a new role to their own team.)
- Click **"Save"**.
- When back to the CITE Dashboard, the new role will appear under roles, ready for a user to be assigned to it.

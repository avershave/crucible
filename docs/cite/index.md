# CITE Overview (Collaborative Incident Threat Evaluator)

CITE is a web application created to integrate with the Crucible Framework and allows multiple participants from multiple organizations to evaluate, score, and comment on cyber incidents. CITE compares a user's score to their organization's score, group average scores, and the official exercise score. Supports scoring submission for every move as the exercise progresses.

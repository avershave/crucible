The Gallery Archive is a “one-stop-shop” archive or collection of articles

![Gallery Archive](../../assets/img/gallery-archive.png)

1. Search and Sources
    
    These articles come from different categories of sources: reporting, news, intel, and social media. The archive contains all “move” data that has been shared up to this point in the exercise. You can search, sort, and filter information in the archive.
    To search the archive, enter your terms in the Search the Archive field. The search feature automatically narrows down your results.
    Different organizations see different information in the Gallery. Some organization may not have access to any of the simulated intelligence content and other organizations may see content from specific regulators that is being simulated within the exercise.  
2. Filter

    You can use the dropdown to further filter intelligence information.
3. Items per page / Wall

    Select the number of items to be displayed on the page. Use the '**<**' and '**>**' to move between pages. 
4. Toggle Gallery Wall

    Click the Wall icon to go to the Gallery Wall.

The information in the Gallery Archive is displayed as cards. Cards contain the title of the intelligence report; icons correspond to the source type of the intelligence report (**News**, **Intel**, **Reporting**, or **Social Media**).

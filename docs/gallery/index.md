# Gallery Overview

Gallery is a web application created to integrate with the Crucible Framework and consists of two parts: the wall and the archive. The wall is a dashboard that displays “cards” to help participants visualize & categorize the incident. The archive is a collection of information that contains relevant reports, intelligence, news, and social media.
